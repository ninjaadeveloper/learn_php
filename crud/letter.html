Dear Zaki
Thank you very much for your last letter. It was great to hear from you after so many months. You seem to be
having a nice time in France.

Thanks also for the photographs. I absolutely loved that snap of yours standing in front of the Eiffel Tower.
France looks stunning. Someday, I would definitely like to go there.

There's not much happening here. I am busy with my work and kids.

By the way, are you coming home anytime soon? If you are, let me know the dates and we can arrange to meet up.

Hope to see you soon!

Affan
